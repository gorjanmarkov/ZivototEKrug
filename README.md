Android application developed using Kotlin and Firebase.


A small Android application developed for my Android class.
Uses Firebase Authentication for login and authentication of users, Firebase Realtime Database for storing the all the needed info for the users.

You can register as an Adult or a Volunteer.

The Adult can create a task that he needs help with in the NewTask tab. The user can put a name, description, time and a location for this task.
All of the tasks that the user has created are available for him in the AllTasks tab of his application.
And he can also review the Volunteer that helped him with this task.

The Volunteer has all the available tasks in his AllTasks tab in the applicaton, by clicking a task he is then assigned to it.
He can see the list of tasks that he has been assigned either pending or finished.
He can also rate the Adult that has created that same task.
